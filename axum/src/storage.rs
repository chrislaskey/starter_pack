//! The server's two buckets, chosen at start from the environment, on
//! the S3 API at `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` (AWS when unset) in `STORAGE_REGION`,
//! with `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`:
//!
//! - `STORAGE_BUCKET`, read by anyone at `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL`, where
//!   pictures go. Unset, the upload routes answer 503.
//! - `STORAGE_PRIVATE_BUCKET`, read through signed URLs only, where
//!   files go. Unset, the files routes answer 503.
//!
//! `bin/storage` runs Garage for dev and sets them.
