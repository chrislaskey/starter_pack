//! The ops app on the web server: its API under `/api/ops`; its pages,
//! a build of their own (`svelte/dist-ops`), at `/ops` and under it;
//! and the commands that say who is staff, `app_web ops staff create
//! <email>` and `delete`. All of it is for staff: to anyone else, signed
//! in or not, every path of it is a 404, as a path that does not exist,
//! so nothing tells them there is an ops app. See
//! `docs/design/multi-app.md`.
