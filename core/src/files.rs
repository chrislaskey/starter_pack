//! Files: a file a person added, as a row that syncs like a post and
//! bytes kept apart from it, see `docs/design/offline-files-decisions.md`.
//! The row holds the name, the content type and the size; the bytes are
//! in the server's bucket at `files/<owner id>/<file id>` and, on a
//! device, in the account's folder under the file's id, see
//! `deployment::FileStore`. The bytes never change: an update changes
//! the name only. Only its owner sees a file.
//!
//! Every write is an event applied by `apply_event`, as a post's is.
//! What differs is the create: the server writes the row only once the
//! file is in its bucket, and answers `file_not_uploaded` until then.
//! On the web the page asks `create_upload` where to PUT the bytes,
//! sends them, then creates the row. A device keeps the bytes itself,
//! `create_with_bytes`, and the file waits there, its create pending,
//! until a sync has sent them. Another device gets the row by the pull
//! and the bytes the first time a page shows the file, `local_copy`,
//! and keeps them.
//!
//! Rows go first and bytes after, on both sides, by looking at what the
//! rows point at now: `delete_unreferenced` in the bucket, daily, and
//! `delete_unreferenced_on_device` in the account's folder, at the end
//! of each sync.
