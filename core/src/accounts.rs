//! Accounts: signing up, signing in and signing out. The server does
//! the work, and the emailed code is what proves who someone is, see
//! `docs/design/accounts-sign-in.md`. A sign-up writes the person's
//! account, `users`, unconfirmed, and their user's row with their name,
//! `crate::users`; a sign-in finds the account by its email; both then
//! make a pending sign-in, `tokens`, and mail its six-digit code,
//! `mails`, answering the pending token the page holds. The code,
//! `sign_in_with_code`, confirms the email the first time, then asks
//! for whatever the account's `second_factors` are, a password being
//! the only one: an account with a password is asked for it,
//! `sign_in_with_password`, and a new account is offered to make one or
//! skip, `sign_in_with_new_password`. Every way ends in `finish_in`: a
//! session token for the browser's cookie, or, for a sign-in a device
//! started in the browser, a device code the device exchanges for its
//! API token, `sign_in_with_device_code`, with the verifier only it
//! holds. A sign-out deletes the token. A trial user, `trial_users`,
//! signs up with `sign_up_from_trial`, which keeps their user and gives
//! their account the address once its code matches.
//!
//! A device never sees a password: it keeps the session the exchange
//! answered, `keep_signed_in`, as the `signed_in` device setting, and a
//! sign-out clears the setting and keeps the data, so signing in again
//! resumes from the cursor; which file a device signs into is the app's
//! business, see `docs/design/device-accounts.md`.
