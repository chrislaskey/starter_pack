//! Device settings: what a person chooses on a device, such as working
//! offline or who is signed in, kept in the device's database as a JSON
//! value per key so a new setting needs no migration. Every setting is
//! declared here, with the value a device starts with, and `upgrade`
//! brings a device up to date with that list when the app starts, so a
//! setting is always there to read. Never synced.
