//! Events: one change a person made to a row, the only way a synced row
//! changes, see "Events" in `docs/design/offline-sync.md`. A resource
//! builds one for each save and applies it with the merge here; the
//! server answers a pushed event the same way, since both run the
//! resource's `apply_event`. The `app_events` table is the server's log
//! of every event answered and a device's queue of events not yet
//! answered, with the conflicts the person has not resolved.
//!
//! An event in the queue is tried by every sync, but not for ever: each
//! time the server or the bucket says no to it and it stays pending
//! counts, `count_attempt`, and at `MAX_ATTEMPTS` it is refused, kept
//! as a conflict with the reason until the person tries it again or
//! lets it go. Not reaching the server counts nothing, and neither does
//! a server or a bucket that is failing, so an outage of any length
//! refuses nothing.
