//! The accounts app's purchasing from a device: its pages' calls, asked
//! of the server's API with the device's token, their JSON answers passed
//! back as they came, so the app needs none of the server's Stripe code.
//! A device is online only for these, see `docs/design/multi-app.md`.
//! Stripe's pages open in the browser and come back to
//! `/accounts/back-to-app`, see `ReturnTo`.
//!
//! The plan is the exception, as the device must know it offline:
//! `plan_refresh` keeps the server's answer in the `plan` device
//! setting, and `plan_kept` trusts it until its period ends. See
//! `docs/design/purchasing.md`.
