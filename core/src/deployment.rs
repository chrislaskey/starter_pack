//! A deployment: the database this web server or app opened, its role,
//! where it keeps the bytes of files, see `files`, and on the server the
//! bucket of users' pictures, see `avatars`. The web server is
//! the system of record; a desktop or mobile app is a device with a copy
//! that syncs with it, see `docs/design/offline-sync.md`. Reads are the
//! same in both roles. A write differs in two places: the server
//! increments the row's version and records the event in its log, a
//! device leaves the version as the server's and queues the event for
//! the next push.
