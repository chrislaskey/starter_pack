  @moduledoc """
  A membership: a user's relationship to a community. Leaving
  soft-deletes the row and rejoining revives the same row, see
  `App.Data.Memberships`, so the unique index on the pair is plain. `role` is `member` for every row until permissions exist.

  Syncs to clients. A membership a client pushes goes through the join
  and leave flows, never on its timestamp alone: the server wins.
