  "This post is in this community", and the membership it was added
  under, `users_communities_id`, which is always the owner's. Leaving a
  community soft-deletes the member's rows through that membership, and
  rejoining revives them, see `App.Data.Memberships`. Removing a post from
  a community soft-deletes its row, and adding it back revives the same
  row, so the unique index on the pair is plain.
